# Set strict a Cross Origin Policy to mitigate information leakage.
#
# (1) Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy prevents a document from loading any
#     cross-origin resources that don’t explicitly grant the document
#     permission.

#     https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#cross-origin-embedder-policy
#     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy
#
# (2) Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy allows you to ensure a top-level document does
#     not share a browsing context group with cross-origin documents.

#     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy
#
# (3) Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy allows to define a policy that lets web
#     sites and applications opt in to protection against certain requests from
#     other origins, to mitigate speculative side-channel attacks.
