# Protect website against clickjacking.
#
# The example below sends the `X-Frame-Options` response header with the value
# `DENY`, informing browsers not to display the content of the web page in any
# frame.
#
# This might not be the best setting for everyone. You should read about the
# other two possible values the `X-Frame-Options` header field can have:
# `SAMEORIGIN` and `ALLOW-FROM`.
# https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034#section-2.1.
#
# Keep in mind that while you could send the `X-Frame-Options` header for all
# of your website's pages, this has the potential downside that it forbids even
# non-malicious framing of your content.
#
# Nonetheless, you should ensure that you send the `X-Frame-Options` header for
# all pages that allow a user to make a state-changing operation (e.g: pages
# that contain one-click purchase links, checkout or bank-transfer confirmation
# pages, pages that make permanent configuration changes, etc.).
#
# Sending the `X-Frame-Options` header can also protect your website against
# more than just clickjacking attacks.

#     which obsoletes this header for supporting browsers.

# Set a strict Referrer Policy to mitigate information leakage.
#
# (1) The `Referrer-Policy` header is included in responses for resources
#     that are able to request (or navigate to) other resources.
#
#     This includes the commonly used resource types:
#     HTML, CSS, XML/SVG, PDF documents, scripts and workers.
#
# To prevent referrer leakage entirely, specify the `no-referrer` value
# instead. Note that the effect could impact analytics metrics negatively.
#
# To check your Referrer Policy, you can use an online service, such as:
# https://securityheaders.com/

# Force client-side TLS (Transport Layer Security) redirection.
#
# If a user types `example.com` in their browser, even if the server redirects
# them to the secure version of the website, that still leaves a window of
# opportunity (the initial HTTP connection) for an attacker to downgrade or
# redirect the request.
#
# The following header ensures that a browser only connects to your server
# via HTTPS, regardless of what the users type in the browser's address bar.
#
# (!) Be aware that Strict Transport Security is not revokable and you
#     must ensure being able to serve the site over HTTPS for the duration
#     you've specified in the `max-age` directive. When you don't have a
#     valid TLS connection anymore (e.g. due to an expired TLS certificate)
#     your visitors will see a nasty error message even when attempting to
#     connect over HTTP.

# (1) Preloading Strict Transport Security.

#     * the `max-age` is specified with a value of at least 31536000 seconds
